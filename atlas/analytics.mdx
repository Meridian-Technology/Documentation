## Two analytics surfaces

Atlas analytics exists in two main places:

### 1) Platform admin analytics (all orgs)

Backend:

- `GET /org-management/analytics?timeRange=7d|30d|90d`

Frontend:

- `Meridian/frontend/src/pages/FeatureAdmin/OrgManagement/Analytics/Analytics.jsx`

What it aggregates:

- total org count, verified org count, new orgs
- member totals (via `OrgMember.aggregate`)
- events created in window (via `Event.aggregate`, `hostingType: 'Org'`)
- verification request counts by status (via `OrgVerification.aggregate`)
- top orgs by member count (via join against `orgs`)

### 2) Org-scoped event analytics (single org)

Backend:

- `GET /org-event-management/:orgId/analytics`

This is gated by org permission `manage_events`.

See `/atlas/event-analytics` for details.

## Developer tips

<Note>
The admin dashboard uses `useFetch`, which will retry after refresh-token on 401.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Important:** Aggregations depend on collection names used by `getModelService.js` (`orgs`, `members`, etc). If you change collection names, analytics will silently break.
</Warning>
