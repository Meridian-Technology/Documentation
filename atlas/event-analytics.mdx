## Scope

These endpoints are used by org leaders to manage org events (distinct from the platform-wide “Beacon” event approval system).

Backend route:

- `Meridian/backend/routes/orgEventManagementRoutes.js`

Mounted at:

- `/org-event-management`

Auth:

- `verifyToken`
- org-scoped permission gate: `requireEventManagement('orgId')` → checks `manage_events`

## Endpoints

### GET `/:orgId/analytics`

<RequestExample>
```bash
GET /org-event-management/abc123/analytics?timeRange=30d&eventType=all
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "totals": {
    "eventsCreated": 25,
    "expectedAttendance": 500,
    "averageAttendance": 20
  },
  "analytics": {
    "views": 1200,
    "uniqueViews": 800,
    "rsvps": 450,
    "engagementRate": 0.375
  },
  "breakdowns": {
    "byType": { "meeting": 15, "social": 10 },
    "byStatus": { "approved": 20, "pending": 5 }
  },
  "topEvents": [...],
  "monthlyTrend": [...],
  "memberEngagement": [...]
}
```
</ResponseExample>

**Query params**:
- `timeRange`: `7d`, `30d`, `90d`, or `1y`
- `eventType`: `all` or specific event type

**Aggregations computed**:
- Totals: events created, expected attendance, average attendance
- Analytics: views, unique views, rsvps, engagement rate (from `EventAnalytics`)
- Breakdowns: by type, by status
- Top events by views
- Monthly trend
- Member engagement proxy (looks up events where member's `user_id` is in `Event.going`)

### GET `/:orgId/events`

- `GET /org-event-management/:orgId/events`

Used for “manage all events” UIs (filters/pagination are in the route file; confirm exact params in code before building new UI).

### GET `/:orgId/events/:eventId`

- fetches a single event with analytics context

### POST `/:orgId/events/bulk-action`

Performs bulk operations across multiple events (e.g. delete/archive/status change). Audit for allowed actions before exposing to UI.

### Templates

- `POST /org-event-management/:orgId/event-templates`
- `GET /org-event-management/:orgId/event-templates`
- `POST /org-event-management/:orgId/events/from-template/:templateId`

These support an “event template” workflow for faster event creation.

## When to use these vs "core event routes"

There are multiple event route families in the backend:

| Route Family | File | Purpose |
|--------------|------|---------|
| Beacon event system | `eventRoutes.js` | Approval/event system |
| Public org events | `orgRoutes.js` | Public listing (`GET /:orgId/events`) |
| Org management | `orgEventManagementRoutes.js` | Org-scoped event management |

<Note>
**If you're building org leader tooling**, use `/org-event-management`.

**If you're building public org pages**, use `GET /:orgId/events`.
</Note>
