## Overview

The Event Dashboard is a comprehensive interface for event managers to prepare and manage events. It provides tools for agenda management, volunteer job assignments, RSVP tracking, and event readiness monitoring.

## Features

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a high-level view of event status and readiness:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Event Readiness"
    icon="clipboard-check"
  >
    Checklist showing agenda publication status, job fill rates, and event publication status
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="RSVP Growth Chart"
    icon="chart-line"
  >
    Visual representation of RSVP growth over time with dynamic projections
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Readiness Checks

1. **Agenda Published**: Indicates whether the agenda has been explicitly published
   - Shows "Pending Changes" when agenda is modified
   - Requires explicit "Publish" action to mark as ready

2. **Jobs Filled**: Tracks volunteer job coverage
   - Shows filled vs required positions
   - Progress bar turns red below 50% coverage
   - Integrated from the Jobs Manager

3. **Event Published**: Indicates if the event is publicly visible

### Agenda Builder

The Agenda Builder allows event managers to create and manage event agendas:

#### Key Features
- Add, edit, and reorder agenda items
- Publish agenda when ready
- Automatic status tracking

#### Publishing Workflow

1. **Create/Modify Agenda**: When agenda items are created, updated, or deleted, `isPublished` is automatically set to `false`
2. **Review Changes**: The agenda shows "Pending Changes" status
3. **Publish**: Click "Publish Agenda" button to explicitly mark as published (`isPublished: true`)

<Warning>
  Any modification to agenda items (create, update, delete) will reset the published status. This ensures agendas are always reviewed before being marked as complete.
</Warning>

### Jobs Manager

The Jobs Manager handles volunteer job assignments and tracking:

#### Key Features
- Create jobs from templates
- Assign volunteers to positions
- Track job coverage
- Remove assignments when needed

#### Assignment Workflow

1. **Create Job Slots**: Add job positions from organization job templates
2. **Assign Volunteers**: Click open slots to assign members
3. **Track Coverage**: View filled vs required positions
4. **Remove Assignments**: Use the remove button (X) to unassign volunteers

#### Job Status

- **Fully Staffed**: Jobs that have met their required count show a green badge
- **Open Slots**: Placeholder slots appear for unfilled positions
- **Assignment Status**: All new assignments default to `'confirmed'` status

<Note>
  Once a job reaches its target number of members, the add dropdown is hidden and no additional members can be assigned.
</Note>

### RSVP Growth Chart

The RSVP Growth Chart visualizes RSVP trends and projections:

#### Features
- **Cumulative View**: Shows total RSVPs over time (default)
- **Daily View**: Toggle to see daily RSVP counts
- **Dynamic Projections**: Future day projections adjust based on actual performance
- **Frozen Data**: Past events show historical data frozen at event date

#### Data Calculation

**Past Days**:
- Uses original predicted cumulative targets for the required growth line
- Actual RSVPs tracked from `EventAnalytics.rsvpHistory` (primary) or `Event.attendees` (fallback)
- Includes guest counts in RSVP totals

**Future Days**:
- Dynamically recalculates required growth based on actual performance
- If behind schedule: increases daily required rate
- If ahead of schedule: decreases daily required rate
- Ensures target is still achievable by event date

#### Data Sources (Priority)

1. `EventAnalytics.rsvpHistory` - Most accurate, indexed timestamps
2. `Event.attendees.rsvpDate` - Fallback if rsvpHistory is empty
3. Even distribution - If only `rsvpStats.going` count is available

### Analytics Tab

The Analytics tab provides detailed event analytics including:
- View counts over time
- RSVP trends
- Export functionality

## Schema Changes

### EventAgenda Schema

Added `isPublished` field:

```javascript
{
  isPublished: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  }
}
```

**Behavior**:
- Defaults to `false` when agenda is created
- Set to `false` automatically when agenda items are modified
- Set to `true` only via explicit publish action

### EventJob Assignments

**Default Status**: All new assignments default to `'confirmed'` status with `confirmedAt` timestamp set.

**Removal**: Assignments can be removed via DELETE endpoint, which removes them from the job's assignments array.

## API Integration

The Event Dashboard integrates with the following API endpoints:

- `POST /org-event-management/{orgId}/events/{eventId}/agenda/publish` - Publish agenda
- `DELETE /org-event-management/{orgId}/events/{eventId}/assignments/{assignmentId}` - Remove assignment
- `GET /org-event-management/{orgId}/events/{eventId}/rsvp-growth` - Get RSVP growth data

See [Event Management API](/api-reference/event-management) for complete documentation.

## Best Practices

1. **Agenda Management**: Always review agenda changes before publishing
2. **Job Assignments**: Monitor job coverage regularly to ensure adequate staffing
3. **RSVP Tracking**: Use the growth chart to identify if additional promotion is needed
4. **Readiness Checks**: Complete all readiness items before event day
