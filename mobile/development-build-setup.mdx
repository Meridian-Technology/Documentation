title: Development Build Setup
---

This guide explains how to install a development build on your physical device (iOS or Android) that is differentiated from your preview build.

## What's the Difference?

- **Preview Build**: A standalone build with your app code bundled in. Installed via TestFlight/Google Play or direct download. Cannot reload code without rebuilding.
- **Development Build**: Includes the Expo development client. Can connect to `expo start` and reload code instantly without rebuilding.

## Key Differences on Your Device

The development build uses a different bundle identifier/package name (`com.meridian.mobile.dev`) so it will:
- Appear as a **separate app** on your home screen
- Coexist with your preview build
- Allow you to connect to `expo start` for hot reloading

---

## iOS Development Build

### Step 1: Build the Development Build

From the `Meridian-Mobile` directory, run:

```bash
npm run build:ios:development
```

Or directly:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

This will:
1. Build a development client with your app
2. Take ~15-30 minutes
3. Generate a QR code and download link when complete

### Step 2: Install on Your iPhone

#### Option A: Via QR Code (Easiest)

1. When the build completes, EAS will show you a QR code
2. Open your iPhone camera
3. Scan the QR code
4. Tap the notification to download
5. Go to Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
6. Trust the developer certificate
7. Open the app

#### Option B: Via Download Link

1. When the build completes, EAS will provide a download link
2. Open the link on your iPhone (Safari)
3. Tap "Install"
4. Go to Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
5. Trust the developer certificate
6. Open the app

### Step 3: Connect to Development Server

Once the development build is installed:

1. **Start the development server** on your computer:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   expo start
   ```

2. **Connect your iPhone**:
   - Make sure your iPhone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network
   - Open the development build app on your iPhone
   - Shake your device (or press `Cmd+D` if using simulator) to open the developer menu
   - Tap "Enter URL manually" or scan the QR code from the terminal
   - Enter your computer's IP address (shown in the terminal), e.g., `exp://192.168.1.XXX:8081`

3. **Load your app**:
   - The app will connect and load your JavaScript bundle
   - You can now make changes and see them instantly with hot reload!

### iOS Troubleshooting

#### "Untrusted Developer" Error

1. Go to Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
2. Find the developer certificate
3. Tap "Trust [Developer Name]"
4. Confirm trust

#### Build Fails

- Make sure you're logged into EAS: `eas login`
- Check your Apple Developer account is linked: `eas credentials`
- Ensure the bundle identifier `com.meridian.mobile.dev` is registered in your Apple Developer account

## Android Development Build

### Step 1: Build the Development Build

From the `Meridian-Mobile` directory, run:

```bash
npm run build:android:development
```

Or directly:

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

This will:
1. Build a development client with your app as an APK
2. Take ~15-30 minutes
3. Generate a QR code and download link when complete

### Step 2: Install on Your Android Device

#### Option A: Via QR Code (Easiest)

1. When the build completes, EAS will show you a QR code
2. Open your Android device camera or a QR code scanner app
3. Scan the QR code
4. Tap the notification to download the APK
5. If prompted, allow installation from unknown sources:
   - Go to Settings → Security → Enable "Install unknown apps" for your browser
6. Tap "Install" when the download completes
7. Open the app

#### Option B: Via Download Link

1. When the build completes, EAS will provide a download link
2. Open the link on your Android device (Chrome or any browser)
3. Download the APK file
4. If prompted, allow installation from unknown sources
5. Tap the downloaded APK file to install
6. Tap "Install" when prompted
7. Open the app

#### Option C: Via ADB (For Developers)

If you have ADB installed:

```bash
# Download the APK first, then:
adb install path/to/your-app.apk
```

### Step 3: Connect to Development Server

Once the development build is installed:

1. **Start the development server** on your computer:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   expo start
   ```

2. **Connect your Android device**:
   - Make sure your Android device and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network
   - Open the development build app on your Android device
   - Shake your device (or press `Cmd+M` / `Ctrl+M` if using emulator) to open the developer menu
   - Tap "Enter URL manually" or scan the QR code from the terminal
   - Enter your computer's IP address (shown in the terminal), e.g., `exp://192.168.1.XXX:8081`

3. **Load your app**:
   - The app will connect and load your JavaScript bundle
   - You can now make changes and see them instantly with hot reload!

### Android Troubleshooting

#### "Install blocked" or "Unknown sources" Error

1. Go to Settings → Security (or Apps & notifications → Special app access)
2. Enable "Install unknown apps" for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
3. Try downloading and installing again

#### Can't Connect to Development Server

1. Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
2. Check your firewall isn't blocking port 8081
3. Try entering the URL manually: `exp://YOUR_IP:8081`
4. Verify your computer's IP address hasn't changed
5. On Android, you may need to use `exp://` instead of `http://`

#### Build Fails

- Make sure you're logged into EAS: `eas login`
- Check your Android credentials: `eas credentials`
- Ensure the package name `com.meridian.mobile.dev` is available (EAS will handle this automatically)

#### Developer Menu Not Appearing

- Shake your device physically
- Or press `Cmd+M` (Mac) / `Ctrl+M` (Windows/Linux) if using an emulator
- Or run: `adb shell input keyevent 82` (if ADB is installed)

## Differentiating the Apps

The development build will appear as a separate app because:
- **iOS Bundle ID**: `com.meridian.mobile.dev` (vs `com.meridian.mobile` for preview)
- **Android Package**: `com.meridian.mobile.dev` (vs `com.meridian.mobile` for preview)
- **App Name**: "Meridian Dev" (vs "Meridian" for preview)

The different bundle ID/package name and app name ensure they're completely separate apps on your device.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Build iOS development build
npm run build:ios:development

# Build Android development build
npm run build:android:development

# Start development server
npm start

# Check iOS build status
eas build:list --platform ios --profile development

# Check Android build status
eas build:list --platform android --profile development
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, you can:
- Make code changes and see them instantly
- Use React Native Debugger
- Test native modules and custom native code
- Develop without rebuilding the app
- Test on physical devices with full native capabilities
