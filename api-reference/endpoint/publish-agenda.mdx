## Notes

- The agenda must have at least one item before it can be published
- Publishing an agenda sets `isPublished: true` and marks it as ready for public viewing
- Any modifications to agenda items (create, update, delete) will automatically reset `isPublished` to `false`
- This endpoint is used in the Event Dashboard's Agenda Builder to explicitly mark the agenda as complete
