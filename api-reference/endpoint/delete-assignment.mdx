## Notes

- The assignment is removed from the job's `assignments` array using MongoDB's `pull` method
- This operation is irreversible - the assignment data is permanently removed
- After deletion, the job's filled count will decrease, potentially making the job available for new assignments
- Used in the Event Dashboard's Jobs Manager when removing a volunteer from a job position
