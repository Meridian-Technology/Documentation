title: "Analytics Collected Events"
description: "Reference of all events collected by the platform analytics pipeline"
---

This document lists all events collected by the Meridian web frontend and sent to the platform analytics pipeline (`POST /v1/events`). For architecture and ingestion details, see [Platform Analytics (Event Pipeline)](/backend/analytics-platform).

## Admin Exclusion

When the `excludeAdminUsersFromTracking` config is enabled (default: `true`), users with the `admin` role are excluded from all tracking. No events are sent for admin users in this case. Configure this in **Feature Admin → Beacon → Analytics**.

- **context** — `screen`, `route`, `referrer`, `locale`, `timezone`
- **properties** — Event-specific payload (no PII)

## Adding New Events

To add new events:

1. Use `analytics.track('event_name', { ...properties })` for actions
2. Use `analytics.screen('Screen Name', { ...properties })` for page views
3. Keep event names in `snake_case`
4. Avoid PII in properties (email, name, phone, etc. are stripped)
5. Update this document when adding new event types
